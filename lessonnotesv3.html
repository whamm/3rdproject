            <li>Computers can do many things very well as long as you give them one step at a time. Programs tell computers what to do in steps and programs are concise sequences of steps</li>

            <li>Python is an interpreter language and an interpreter language directly executes instructions written in code without compiling</li>

            <li>Programming has grammar just like english. There are correct and incorrect ways of saying things</li>

            <li>An expression is something that has a value</li>

            <li>An equal sign in math means equals but in a programming an equal sign means assignment. Assigning the value of the right side to the left</li>

        </div>

        <ul>

            <li>A variable in python is a box that can hold a value that is assigned to it
            Assigning a variable is as simple as declaring example = 9 or more complicated as example2= 1 + 3 858 - 351</li>

            <li>Assigning the value of the right side to the left
            Variables can be useful when you need to store a value that will be referenced multiple times or will be changing throughout a program</li>

            <li>Variables can be numbers and strings 
            Numbers and strings are two different data types and generally cannot be used in equations</li>

        </div>

        <ul>

            <li>A function is a block of code that take an argument that is input when you call it and executes that against the block of code within the function</li>

            <li>You must create a function to use it. When making it, it requires you name it with def, give the function parameters it will operate on later, and code to run the parameter against</li>

            <li>When using a function you generally have to pass it the required arguments that it then executes against its code block</li>

            <li>Functions can be called repeatedly so you can implement it in multiple spots throughout a larger project. This makes it so you are able to more flexibly reuse the same code over and over</li>

            <li>You must always have a return statement otherwise nothing will happen with your function</li>

            <li>Else statements will have a code block execute when your if statement that preceded it didn't evaluate true</li>

            <li>While loops execute similar to if statements except execute over and over as long as the statement in the while loop proofs to true</li>

            <li>For loops look at each item in a list that you can then have a code block execute against</li>

        <ul>

            <li>OOB is a programming paradigm and not a programming language. Programming languages can be OOB programming languages</li>
            <li>OOB programming is commonly used in many projects large and small because of the modularity, dynamism, and reusability of code written in a OOB manner</li>
            <li>When programming in an OOB you will be able to reuse funtion(methods) that are defined in a class so you can reuse blocks of code to repeat the same thing but for different objects</li>
            <li>It is advantageous to program with an OOB model so you don't have to repeat things similarly to how you don't have to repeat CSS by having it in a separate file that your HTML can reference as many time as you need that styling.</li>

        </div>
         <ul>

            <li>Object: An object is a model of what can be done within a class. The object can be a variable, function, and/or data.</li>
            <li>Class: A Class is expandable code for creating objects</li>
            <li>Instance: An instance is a specfic implimentation of a class. In the same way that you have a fish being a class, salmon is a class, and a salmon named mary is an instance.</li>
            <li>Method: A Method is a procedure/function that is inside of a class</li>
            <li>Module: A Module is a file that you import to your program to then access it's contents for methods and classes.</li>
            <li>Library: A library is a repository of prebuilt classes and functions that will help you with tasks that are oriented around the library.</li>
            <li>Class Variable: A class variable is a variable defined in side of a class that many different instances of the class can take advantage of.</li>
            <li>Variable Inheritance: Variable inheritance is where a variable is definied in a parent class but is being used by a child class inheriting it. That variable doesn't then need to be defined in the same manner as it is in the parent class</li>
            <li>Method Overriding: This is a feature that allows a child class to have its method be method be utilized instead of parent method that has already been written.</li>
