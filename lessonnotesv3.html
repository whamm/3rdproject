            <li>Programming has grammar just like english. There are correct and incorrect ways of saying things</li>

            <li>An expression is something that has a value</li>

            <li>An equal sign in math means equals but in a programming an equal sign means assignment. Assigning the value of the right side to the left</li>

        <ul>

            <li>A variable in python is a box that can hold a value that is assigned to it
            Assigning a variable is as simple as declaring example = 9 or more complicated as example2= 1 + 3 858 - 351</li>

            <li>Assigning the value of the right side to the left
            Variables can be useful when you need to store a value that will be referenced multiple times or will be changing throughout a program</li>

            <li>Variables can be numbers and strings 
            Numbers and strings are two different data types and generally cannot be used in equations</li>

        <ul>

            <li>A function is a block of code that take an argument that is input when you call it and executes that against the block of code within the function</li>

            <li>You must create a function to use it. When making it, it requires you name it with def, give the function parameters it will operate on later, and code to run the parameter against</li>

            <li>When using a function you generally have to pass it the required arguments that it then executes against its code block</li>

            <li>Functions can be called repeatedly so you can implement it in multiple spots throughout a larger project. This makes it so you are able to more flexibly reuse the same code over and over</li>

            <li>You must always have a return statement otherwise nothing will happen with your function</li>

            <li>While loops execute similar to if statements except execute over and over as long as the statement in the while loop proofs to true</li>

            <h3 class ="subheading">The DL of OOP</h3>

        </div>

        <ul>

            <li>OOP is a programming paradigm and not a programming language. Programming languages can be OOP programming languages</li>

            <li>OOP programming is commonly used in many projects large and small because of the modularity, dynamism, and reusability of code written in a OOP manner</li>

            <li>When programming in an OOP you will be able to reuse funtion(methods) that are defined in a class so you can reuse blocks of code to repeat the same thing but for different objects</li>

            <li>In relation to the previous bullet point OOP is also very useful for the fact that you can borough from libraries to accomplish thing without writting the code yourself.</li>

            <li>It is advantageous to program with an OOP model so you don't have to repeat things similarly to how you don't have to repeat CSS by having it in a separate file that your HTML can reference as many time as you need that styling. You can think of a class in OOP working very similarly to a class in HTML/CSS. All of the stylings are abscracted from your html docs typically to reduce the size of them and the complexity of them and then can be referenced for use in many different html docs.</li>

            <li>OOP could be compared to CSS as well for how method overriding works in OOP programming. If you have a method that was already implemented in a parent class it can be declared in a child class to override the parent and use its implmentation of it. The same can be said of CSS that a class can be specified and overridden by other CSS rules if the CSS rules apply to an element that is broader selector.</li>

            <li>When coding properly with OOP you will be abstracting much of the information about the code you could be working on to decrease the complexity of it and the bloat of it.</li>

            <li>One of the great things OOP grants us is that you can use other code in class and modules that can make what you are building take less time and effort.</li>

            <li>A class can have many different instances so the class can be utilized many times</li>

        </ul>

            <h3 class ="subheading">OOP Dictionary</h3>

        </div>
         <ul>

            <li>Object: An object is everything that will be created from the "model" of the class. The object is just an idea until you create an instance of it.</li>
            <li>Class: A Class is reusabele and expandable. It is reusable in the way of creating many different instances of an object that the class creates.</li>
            <li>Instance: An instance is a specfic implimentation of a class object. In the same way that you have a fish being a class, salmon is a class, and a salmon named mary is an instance.</li>
            <li>Method: A Method is a procedure/function that is part of a class</li>
            <li>Module: A Module is a file that you import to your program to then access it's contents for methods and classes.</li>
            <li>Library: A library is a collection of modules and classes that can be imported to your code that you can make yourself or use one that someone else has written.</li>
            <li>Class Variable: A class variable is a variable defined in side of a class that many different instances of the class can take advantage of.</li>
            <li>Variable Inheritance: Variable inheritance is where a variable is definied in a parent class but is being used by a child class inheriting it. That variable doesn't then need to be defined in the same manner as it is in the parent class</li>
            <li>Method Overriding: This is a feature that allows a child class to have its method be method be utilized instead of parent method that has already been written.</li>
